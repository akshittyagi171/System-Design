# SOLID Design Principles

SOLID is a set of five design principles that aim to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. It is a foundational concept for writing clean code in software development.

## 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

### Definition:
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

### Example:
```java
// Bad example: The class has multiple responsibilities - managing users and handling file operations.
class User {
    public void saveToFile(User user) {
        // logic to save user data to file
    }
    
    public void getUserData() {
        // logic to get user data
    }
}

// Good example: Separation of concerns with two classes.
class UserService {
    public void getUserData() {
        // logic to get user data
    }
}

class FileManager {
    public void saveToFile(User user) {
        // logic to save user data to file
    }
}
```

## 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

### Definition:
A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

### Example:
```java
// Bad example: Direct modification of an existing class.
class Rectangle {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateArea(Rectangle rectangle) {
        return rectangle.width * rectangle.height;
    }
}

// Good example: Extending functionality using inheritance.
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double calculateArea();
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;
    
    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;
    
    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

## 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

### Definition:
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

### Example:
```java
// Bad example: A subclass that violates LSP by altering expected behavior.
class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying");
    }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostrich cannot fly");
    }
}

// Good example: Reorganizing the hierarchy.
class Bird { }

class FlyingBird extends Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying");
    }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    // Ostrich does not override fly, preserving LSP
}
```

## 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

### Definition:
A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

### Example:
```java
// Bad example: One large interface forcing implementation of unrelated methods.
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}

class HumanWorker implements Worker {
    public void work() {
        // working
    }
    public void eat() {
        // eating
    }
}

class RobotWorker implements Worker {
    public void work() {
        // working
    }
    public void eat() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Robots do not eat");
    }
}

// Good example: Segregating interfaces based on their purpose.
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

class HumanWorker implements Workable, Eatable {
    public void work() {
        // working
    }
    
    public void eat() {
        // eating
    }
}

class RobotWorker implements Workable {
    public void work() {
        // working
    }
}
```

---

## 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

### Definition:
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Also, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

### Example:
```java
// Bad example: High-level class depends on low-level classes.
class LightBulb {
    public void turnOn() {
        // turns on the light
    }
    
    public void turnOff() {
        // turns off the light
    }
}

class Switch {
    private LightBulb lightBulb;
    
    public Switch(LightBulb lightBulb) {
        this.lightBulb = lightBulb;
    }
    
    public void operate() {
        // operates the switch
        lightBulb.turnOn();
    }
}

// Good example: Using abstraction to reduce coupling.
interface Switchable {
    void turnOn();
    void turnOff();
}

class LightBulb implements Switchable {
    public void turnOn() {
        // turns on the light
    }
    
    public void turnOff() {
        // turns off the light
    }
}

class Switch {
    private Switchable device;
    
    public Switch(Switchable device) {
        this.device = device;
    }
    
    public void operate() {
        device.turnOn();
    }
}
```

## Importance of SOLID Principles

1. **Maintainability**: By following SOLID principles, your code becomes easier to maintain and refactor. The code is structured in a way that minimizes the impact of changes.
   
2. **Flexibility**: SOLID principles encourage writing code that is easy to extend and modify, making the system more adaptable to changing requirements.
   
3. **Testability**: Code adhering to SOLID principles is easier to test since components are decoupled and have single responsibilities.
   
4. **Scalability**: Applying these principles helps in designing scalable systems, where new features can be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase.

5. **Readability**: SOLID code tends to be more readable and understandable, leading to better collaboration among developers.

By utilizing SOLID design principles, developers create code that is more robust, easier to extend, and less prone to bugs, ensuring long-term success and efficiency in software projects.
